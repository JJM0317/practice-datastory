          <h2>About School-Based Health Centers & Our Task</h2>

          <p class="lead">Across Connecticut, many students navigate their school days carrying more than backpacks—they carry obstacles that make basic healthcare difficult to access. Some lack insurance, others can’t get to appointments, and many wait weeks for openings that never come soon enough. School Based Health Centers (SBHCs) disrupt this pattern by placing medical, dental, and mental health services directly where students already are. When care is woven into the school environment, barriers that once felt immovable suddenly shrink, creating a clearer path for students to receive support they might otherwise go without.</p>

          <p>In Connecticut, the <a href="https://ctschoolhealth.org/">Connecticut Association of School Based Health Centers </a> (CASBHC) defines SBHCs as “comprehensive primary health care facilities licensed as outpatient clinics or as hospital satellites…located within or on school grounds and serve students in grades pre-K–12.” These centers differ from school nurse offices, though collaboration between the two is common. SBHCs provide medical, dental, and mental health services that support students across a wide range of needs. For our project, we are analyzing the hours of care across more than 300 SBHCs to address two key questions for CASBHC:
            1) How do hours of operation vary across Connecticut? 
            
            2) Is there a relationship between hours open and indicators of community need such as free or reduced-price lunch eligibility? 
            
            By examining patterns in service availability, our goal was to identify areas where students may face reduced access to school-based healthcare and to help CASBHC better understand whether certain communities encounter gaps in SBHC availability.</p>

          
           <h4>Caution About Questionable Data</h4>

          <p>As with any dataset, no data is perfect. SBHC schedules are reported in very different ways. For example, some schools do not list the specific days or hours they are open, such as Mountain View School in the Bristol School district which is reported to offer medical, mental health, and dental health services though there are no operation hours listed. To compensate for these discrepancies, we had to make assumptions that if days and/or hours were not listed then a standard Monday - Friday, with hours from about 8am - 3pm were instated as the “default”. Other schools list generalized hours, or even failed to specify the offered services. In addition to this, some SBHCs are listed with improbable combinations of hours and services. For example, one listing stated that they had a mobile dental service available Monday through Friday during daytime school hours, though those vehicles are designed to move between different schools throughout the day, therefore we can conclude this report may be inaccurate. All of these issues raise questions about data accuracy. By addressing these doubts, we can accept that no dataset is perfect and continue to work with the best available data.</p>

          <p>Compose your data story in your Google Doc, where it's easier to write and edit, especially when working with other people. When you're ready, create your own copy of this <a href="https://github.com/DataVizForAll/dataviz-story-template">GitHub dataviz-story-template </a>, and publish it online using Settings > Pages. When your version is published, copy and paste the live web link into your README file so you can easily find it.</p>

          <p>In your GitHub copy of this template, open the "index.html" file to see how everything must be written in HTML format. Click the pencil symbol in GithHub to edit the file. HINT: In the upper-right corner, switch the dropdown menu from "No Wrap" to "Soft Wrap" to easily view long segments of code in your screen.</p>

          <p>Paragraphs like this one must begin with a "p" tag and end with a "p" closing tag.</p>

          <p>Links must begin and end with "a" anchor tags, with the web address inside either single or double quotes. If you need guidance, check out this <a href='https://ctschoolhealth.org/'>CTSchoolHealth link</a>.

          <p>Change default navigation labels (such as "Section 1") to customized labels to guide your readers. While some authors use traditional headers (such as "Findings" or "Sources & Methods"), you're welcome to innovate with more creative headers (such as "Why It Matters" or "How We Made This"). Be sure to EDIT names in TWO locations in the template: the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections labels further below. EDIT only the reader-friendly labels, and do not change the underlying code.</p>

          <h2>Thesis Findings</h2>

           <p class="lead">Weekly SBHC hours show a weak positive correlation with free and reduced-price lunch eligibility and centers operating 35 or more hours per week are concentrated mainly in major urban districts. This pattern suggests that operational capacity is shaped more by geographic and structural factors than by socioeconomic indicators alone. The widespread presence of sub-maximum operating hours across SBHCs indicates limited access for many students, highlighting the need to understand how these variations affect the availability of essential school-based healthcare.</p>

          <h3>Verifying Our Data</h3>

          <p>To take caution, we flagged 10 SBHCs with questionably reported hours and services, and called each school’s phone number to directly ask for clarification. Out of the ten schools called, only one of them was able to confirm our exact data, as shown in the table below.</p>

          <p>Embed each of your published visualizations as an HTML iframe code, following instructions in <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/embed.html'>Chapter 9 of HODV</a>, similar to the sample below.</p>

          <p>However, these verifications do not suggest the entire dataset is wrong; instead, they highlight CASBHC’s need for more consistent, higher-quality data entries on SBHC hours and services in order to carry out its work effectively. The dataset is still trustworthy, but the inconsistencies we identified reveal where reporting practices falter. These gaps reflect broader challenges in how SBHCs communicate their schedules and services, illustrating the growing pains of a system that is still developing standardized procedures. Even inconsistent findings are meaningful ones, as they pinpoint areas where improvements in data reporting can strengthen future analyses and support SBHC advocacy.</p>

           <p>The point map visualizes the weekly operating hours of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) across Connecticut. Each center is shown as a circular marker placed at its geographic location, with color intensity indicating the number of hours offered per week. A sequential blue palette is used. Lighter blue dots represent fewer hours like partial-days, while darker blues represent more hours, like half or full-days. Blue, in particular, was chosen because it is widely associated with positive or neutral meaning, avoiding the negative or alarming connotations often linked to red. The sequential design reinforces the continuous nature of the data, allowing readers to intuitively understand the low-to-high variation in operating hours. The map reveals clusters of darker markers in Connecticut’s largest cities—Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, Stamford, and Waterbury, suggesting longer service hours are prominent in these areas, while lighter markers appear more frequently in smaller towns, indicating more limited weekly availability.</p>

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future Trinity College students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, like this example from <a href='https://data.ct.gov'>CT Open Data</a>. Also link to your shared Google Sheets when appropriate.</p>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="screenshots/sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Enrollment Dashboard”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

  <p>Lurye, Rebecca. “New Housing Code in Hartford Would Keep Slumlords from Hiding Behind LLCs.” Hartford Courant, May 31, 2019. <a href='https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html'>https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html</a>.</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>EDIT Section 4 Label: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
